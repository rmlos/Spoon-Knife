#Before you edit the docs

* Briefly check with TechComm about what you want to edit. You can drop by or send a Slack message to #rd-techcomm. We'll help you navigate the content that is over 900 files.

* Know the content types. Here they are: conceptual (intros and docs about how things work), procedural (mostly numbered lists on how to do something), referential (for example, big tables listing extra details). You should edit procedural and referential content.
